# UNP-Project_BI-with-Power-BI_Unemployment-

   
I completed this project using PowerBI as part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Understanding the dataset:

This project is based on unemployment data. Unemployment is an important macroeconomc indicator for several reasons. The amount of unemployment speaks to how well our economy is operating. Analytics can help us understand to what extent and further distinguish aspects of our social framework that lead children and yound adults to grow up into unemployment.

Data Transformation:

We transformed the raw data into meaningful data by cleaning it, transposing the data using unpivot option

Dashboard:

1.Created a dashboard to know about Unemployment trend by countries over the years.

2.In order to understand and know about individual countries it is important that we understand the trend. So, we used line chart and number cards to represent it.

3.By observing at the line chart we observed a drastic increase and in order to keenly know about the change we have used a graph to plot it.

4.We have designed a map representation for our data but to make it even more understandable we turned our graph to a heat map.

Insights:

Unemployment rate is peak during the recession period

1)Lesotho (LSO) is the highest country with unemployment rate of 30.40

2)Qatar (QAT) is in the least among all the countries with 0.57

3)Globally the average unemployment rate is 8.01

4)The COVID-19 global recession is unique in many aspects and has Drastic fall in the year of 2019-21

5)Unemployment rate is also based on regional disparities

6)The intensity of the heatmap is higher in the Europe continent. This means that the unemployment rate is higher in this region

Key Highlights:

1.Contributed to the creation of sophisticated KPIs and dynamic, interactive powerbi interfaces.

2.Diligently engaged in building a data model.

3.Used DAX to perform data transformations and computations for precise reporting and analysis.
